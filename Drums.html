        <h4> I've been playing music my whole life; I started on guitar, changed to bass guitar after a few years, and eventually landed on drums as I enjoy it
            the most by far. I am self-taught and learn off of YouTube videos and sheet music that I find online. I have found that getting better at drums
            comes with listening to a lot of music and hearing how the drums are utilized in different genres. These are some albums that I've listened to throughout
            the years that have influenced how I think about and play the drums.   </h4>
