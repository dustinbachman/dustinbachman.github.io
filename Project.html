        <h1 id = seniorProject> Senior Project: Mix Match Magic </h1>
        <h4 class = mix> For my senior project, in the Fall 2023 semester, I was part of a four person group that created a website entitled
            Mix Match Magic. The idea of the website was to have a place for users to upload images of their wardrobe, and be able to generate an outfit
            based on the color and season of each article of clothing. We envisioned it as a way for users to keep track of their clothes, help them pick out outfits, 
            and save money by putting the clothes they already have into new outfits. The database was hosted with Google Firebase, the website itself was 
            mostly created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below are several videos showing what we implemented by the deadline. </h4>
